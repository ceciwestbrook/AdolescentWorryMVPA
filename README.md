# Developmental Worry MVPA
This is the accompanying analysis code for the RT Disengagement, PI Hallion. Please see our preregistration at https://osf.io/qy4df and preprint at https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/3rv7n_v1 for more information.

All code and associated documents were written by Ceci Westbrook 2022-2025 unless otherwise noted.

 # Task description: # 
Participants provided self-generated worry topics during an interview on a preceding session, as well as associated reappraisal statements, all of which were converted to scanner stimuli. They provided a total of 16 worry statements and 8 reappraisal statements, and were also assigned 10 neutral statements selected randomly from a larger pool. The fMRI task was completed on a subsequent visit. For each trial in the Worry condition, self-generated worry stimuli were presented for ~30s, during which they were instructed to worry as normal. On half of trials, this was then followed by a reappraisal statement during which they were instructed to reappraise their worry (Reappraisal condition). On Neutral trials, they were presented with Neutral stimuli for approximately 30s. Participants could rate their level of worry starting 10s into the trial using a 1-5 scale on a data glove. Trials were pseudorandomized in order.
